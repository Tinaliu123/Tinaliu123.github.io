Hi, I am an senior undergraduate student at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), majoring Artificial Intelligence in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm). Currently, I am visiting in University of Illinois Urbana Champaign advised by Professor [Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html), working on Knowledge Editing. Last summer, I was fortunate to do my summer internship under Professor [Jiantao Jiao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jiantao/) and [Banghua Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/) at University of California, Berkeley. My research interest mainly focus on natural language processing. Currently I am interested in the following topics:

1. **Language Models’ Explainability and Interpretability**: Recent advancements in NLP have been significantly driven by pre-trained language models. Yet, the understanding of their internal workings remains limited, posing risks in practical applications. Currently, I am particularly interested in how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode knowledge, as they can be conceived as repositories of knowledge. Having LLMs retrieve in their own parametric implicitly and explicitly can have totally different behaviors. Furthermore, I want to explore more methods for LLMs to organize knowledge like disentangling information storage.

2. **Language Models’ Reasoning and Planning Ability**: In my previous PlanBench project, I discovered that LLMs fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) exhibited a superior generalized planning capabilities even in complex tasks where traditional algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) faltered. This experience has led me to believe that advanced LLMs could be ideal for planning in real-world scenarios. I also theorize that effective planning is closely linked to commonsense reasoning. Moving forward, my goal is to augment the capabilities of LLMs by delving into their underlying reasoning and planning mechanisms.

3. **Information Retrieval Algorithms and Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RaLMs)**: Information retrieval (IR) plays a crucial role in creating transparent and dependable AI systems. Presently, LLMs grapple with issues of data fabrication or 'hallucination.' Employing retrieval methods enables LLMs to source evidence for their outputs, thereby enhancing their reliability.
