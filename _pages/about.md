Hi,I am a third year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, multimodal large language model and remote sensing image processing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gui-Song Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=SAUCVsEAAAAJ) of [Captain Lab](http://www.captain-whu.com/team.html) from School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. 
You can find my CV here: [Liu Yi's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
